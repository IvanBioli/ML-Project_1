# ML project 1 - Higgs Boson
This git repository is part of the project 1 deliverable in the CS-433 class at EPFL. The aim is to do a binary classification on a 30 feature data set. We want to classify whether it is a strange or bottom quarks.
We implemented six different regressors, created an optimized regressor and did the feature preprocessing.
